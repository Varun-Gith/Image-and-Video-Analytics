# Image-and-Video-Analytics
image and video processing in Matlab 
Assignment 1 :  program to perform the following operations
Resize,Rotation of images, Conversion of colors - (grayscale to binary), (color image to grayscale), Histogram equalization and Image filtering
Assignment 2 : Contrast Enhancement - imadjust, histeq, and adapthisteq, Contrast Stretching - stretchlim.
Assignment 3: Image Sharpening & Image Smoothing.
Assignment 4: Filtering operation on the grayscale image(s) using linear and non-linear filtering methods.
Assignment 5: calculate the mean value of every row in a two dimensional matrix M * N and to determine the frequency of each pixel occurring in a column of an image.
Assignment 6: contrast stretching and Power Law transformation (Gamma Correction) using both built-in and User defined functions and a program to resize the image using both built-in and User defined functions
Assignment 7: Spatial filtering using Built-in and user defined functions with different size of kernels. (Smoothing, Sharpening) & Non linear filtering using Built-in and user defined functions with different size of kernels. (Ex: Median, Mid-point, Min, Max filters)
Assignment 8: filtering in frequency domain (Both Low and High pass filtering using Ideal, Butterworth and Gaussian )
